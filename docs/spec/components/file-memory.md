# File-Based Agent Memory (Protocol)

Hi-Boss agent memory is stored as **plain Markdown files** inside each agent’s `internal_space/`. These files are the durable, human-editable source of truth; indexes/caches (SQLite, vector DBs, search indexes) are optional accelerators and are rebuildable.

This document specifies the **v1 private memory protocol** (per-agent). Team shared workspace is handled separately via `{{HIBOSS_DIR}}/teamspaces/<team-name>/`.

## Goals

- **Local-first:** all durable memory is local files.
- **Git-backupable:** a repo can back up memory with frequent commits/pushes.
- **Human-readable:** operators can read/edit memory without special tooling.
- **Prompt-bounded:** injected memory stays within a predictable size budget.
- **Extendable:** future indexing (e.g., QMD) can be layered on without changing file truth.

## Directory layout (canonical)

Per agent:

```text
{{HIBOSS_DIR}}/agents/<agent-name>/internal_space/
  MEMORY.md                     # long-term (core) memory (auto-injected)
  memories/                     # daily memory (auto-injected: latest N files; truncated)
    2026-02-11.md
    2026-02-10.md
    ...
  history/                      # session history (json + journal + markdown)
    2026-03-03/
      <chat-id>/
        <session-id>.json
        <session-id>.events.ndjson
        <session-id>.md
```

Notes:
- `internal_space/` is included in provider CLI `--add-dir`, so agents can read/write these files during work.
- `memories/` is append-friendly and safe to prune/archive later.
- `history/<date>/<chat-id>/<session-id>.md` stores per-session conversation records and frontmatter summary metadata.
- Session history events are append-written to `history/*.events.ndjson` during an active session.
- Hi-Boss periodically compacts active-session journals into `history/*.json` (event-count / time thresholds).
- On session close, journal events are compacted into `history/*.json`, markdown companion is updated, and the journal file is cleared.
- Hi-Boss ensures the internal space layout exists during setup and at session start. If `MEMORY.md` is missing, it is created as an empty file.

## Memory tiers

### Long-term (core): `internal_space/MEMORY.md`

Purpose:
- Stable preferences, constraints, workflows, and durable project context.
- High signal density; written to be injected on every new session.

Format:
- Plain Markdown is allowed, but keep it compact (prefer bullets and short lines).
- Avoid raw transcripts. Store abstractions (“boss prefers concise bullets”, not a full chat log).
- **Never** store secrets (tokens, API keys, passwords).

### Daily: `internal_space/memories/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Purpose:
- A lightweight activity + decision log for the day.
- A scratchpad for things that might be promoted into long-term memory later.

Format (recommended, not required):
- One short memory per line.
- No timestamps required.
- No headings/categories required.

Example:

```text
Boss prefers concise bullet summaries.
Use internal_space/memories/YYYY-MM-DD.md for daily notes.
Do not store secrets in memory files.
```

Rules:
- Daily files should not be transcripts; store outcomes and references (paths/links), not full raw text.
- The day is derived from the filename; do not repeat the date as top-level metadata.
- When something becomes durable, copy the relevant line(s) into `internal_space/MEMORY.md` (no special format conversion).

## Curation responsibility (v1)

- Agents may append to today’s daily file during work.
- Updating `MEMORY.md` is manual and best-effort (when the agent learns something stable/reusable).
- Session summary generation (`summary`) is not handled by a daemon background worker.

## Prompt injection (current behavior)

On each new session, Hi-Boss injects:
1. A truncated snapshot of `internal_space/MEMORY.md` (long-term), then
2. A truncated snapshot of recent daily memory (latest **N** files), then
3. Session summary snapshots from recent history markdown files (`summary + session-id + file path`).

This keeps “always-on” memory small while still providing a short recency window.
If no daily files exist yet, the injected daily snapshot is empty.

## Size constraints (defaults)

These defaults are chosen to keep prompt cost predictable:

- **Total injected memory budget:** ~20,000 chars
- **Long-term injected max (`MEMORY.md`):** ~12,000 chars
- **Recent daily injected max (combined):** ~8,000 chars (per-day max × days)
- **Recent daily per-day injected max:** ~4,000 chars
- **Recent daily window:** last **2** days/files
- **Session summary window:** last **3** history date directories (configurable)
- **Session summary per-session max:** ~24,000 chars per session (configurable)

Enforcement:
- Injection is truncated when limits are exceeded and a visible truncation marker is appended to the injected snapshot.
- Truncation should not silently discard content without a marker (agents must notice and compact).

## Backup compatibility

If envelopes are treated as disposable, a recovery-capable backup only needs:
- `internal_space/MEMORY.md`
- `internal_space/memories/*.md`
- `internal_space/history/**/*.md`
- `internal_space/history/**/*.json`
- `internal_space/history/**/*.events.ndjson`

Everything else (SQLite queue/audit, vector stores, indexes) is rebuildable runtime state.
