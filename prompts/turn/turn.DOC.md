# Turn Format (Documentation)

The turn input is rendered by the prompt template entrypoint:

- `prompts/turn/turn.md`

CLIClaw supplies fields as template variables (see `prompts/VARIABLES.md`).

## Sections

1. **Turn Context** — current time (local timezone)
2. **Envelopes** — one block per envelope (no per-envelope headers)

Separators:
- A `---` line separates major sections and envelopes.

## Turn Context

Always printed:

```
## Turn Context

now: <local ISO-8601>
pending-envelopes: <n>
```

## Envelopes

When there are no pending envelopes:

```
No pending envelopes.
```

When there are pending envelopes, each envelope is printed as:

```
envelope-id: <id>                  # always (short id)
from: <address>
chat: <chat-id>                    # only when metadata.chatScope exists
sender: <sender line>             # only for channel messages
created-at: <local ISO-8601>
deliver-at: <local ISO-8601>      # only when present
cron-id: <id>                     # only when present (short id)
```

Then the body is printed as plain text (or `(none)`), followed by an `attachments:` block only when present.

Notes:
- Reply targets: use the incoming `from:` as `--to`. Use `--reply-to <envelope-id>` when you need thread context or Telegram quoting.
- The boss signal is the `[boss]` suffix (not a `from-boss:` output key).
- Each pending envelope is rendered one-by-one (no batching).
