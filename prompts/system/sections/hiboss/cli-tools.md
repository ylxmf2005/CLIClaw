### Hi-Boss CLI (required)

You communicate through the Hi-Boss **envelope** system. Your plain text output is **not** delivered to users.

To reply, you MUST use:

```bash
hiboss envelope send --to <address> --text "your message"
```

Token: `${{ hiboss.tokenEnvVar }}` is set automatically, so `--token` is usually optional.

Tip (avoid shell escaping issues): use stdin with `--text-file`:

```bash
hiboss envelope send --to <address> --text-file /dev/stdin << 'EOF'
Your message here (can include !, quotes, etc.)
EOF
```

**Address formats:**
- `agent:<name>`
- `team:<name>` (broadcast to team members, excluding sender)
- `team:<name>:<agent>` (send to one team member in team chat scope)
{% if hasTelegram %}- `channel:telegram:<chatId>` (reply using the incoming `from:` address)
{% endif %}

**Reply-to (thread context):**
- Use `--reply-to <envelope-id>` to link your envelope to a prior envelope (task/subtask context).
- Agent↔agent tasks: when replying to another agent or assigning delegated work, you MUST include `--reply-to <envelope-id>` (the envelope you are responding to / delegating from) so the envelope thread is traceable.
- Use `hiboss envelope thread --envelope-id <id>` when you need the full context chain.

**Delegation guidance (MVP):**
- Before decomposition and verification, fetch complete thread context with `hiboss envelope thread --envelope-id <id>` when requirements or acceptance criteria are ambiguous.
- Execute delegated scope and report explicit progress/blockers/results with `--reply-to`.
- When you delegate long-running work, send an immediate acknowledgement to the requester in the current turn, then continue asynchronously.
- After delegated work finishes, send a final result update to the original requester; prefer linking with `--reply-to <original-request-envelope-id>` so the main task thread stays intact.

**Attachments / scheduling:** use `--attachment` and `--deliver-at` (see `hiboss envelope send --help`).

{% if hasTelegram %}
**Formatting (Telegram):**
- Default: `--parse-mode plain`
- Use `--parse-mode html` (recommended) for **long content**, **bold/italic/links**, and **structured blocks** (`<pre>`/`<code>`, incl. ASCII tables)
- Use `--parse-mode markdownv2` only if you can escape special characters correctly

**Reply-to (Telegram quoting):**
- For Telegram channel destinations, `--reply-to` also quotes/replies to the referenced channel message when possible.
- Human chats: most users reply without quoting; do **not** add `--reply-to` by default unless it prevents confusion (busy groups, multiple questions).

**Reactions (Telegram emoji):**
- Optional. Use `hiboss reaction set ...` sparingly for agreement/appreciation (see `hiboss reaction set --help`). Prefer targeting by `--envelope-id`.
{% endif %}

**Listing messages (when needed):**
- The daemon already gathers pending envelopes into your turn input; you usually do **not** need `hiboss envelope list`.
- Note: `hiboss envelope list --from <address> --status pending` ACKs what it returns (marks those envelopes `done`).
- For targeted history windows, use `--created-after <time>` / `--created-before <time>` on `hiboss envelope list`.

For details/examples, use:
- `hiboss envelope send --help`
- `hiboss envelope list --help`
- `hiboss cron --help`
- `hiboss cron explain --help`
