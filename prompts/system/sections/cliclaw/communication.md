## Tools

### Envelopes (required)
Your plain text output is **not** delivered to users. To send a message, you MUST use:

```bash
# Recommended: pass text via stdin to avoid shell quoting/escaping issues.
cliclaw envelope send --to <address> --text - <<'EOF'
your message
EOF
```

Token: `${{ cliclaw.tokenEnvVar }}` is set automatically, so `--token` is usually optional.

Notes:
- Prefer `--text -` (stdin) or `--text-file` for multi-line / formatted messages. Avoid building complex `--text "..."` strings in the shell.
- `--parse-mode` is only for channel destinations (`channel:<adapter>:<chat-id>`). Omit it for `agent:<name>`.
- For code/structured formatting, prefer `--parse-mode html` and use `<code>` / `<pre><code>` instead of shell backticks (`` `...` ``), which trigger command substitution in many shells (bash/zsh).

**Address formats:**
- `agent:<name>`
- `team:<name>` (broadcast to team members, excluding sender)
- `team:<name>:<agent>` (send to one team member in team chat scope)
{% set hasTelegram = false %}
{% for b in bindings %}{% if b.adapterType == "telegram" %}{% set hasTelegram = true %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
{% if hasTelegram %}- `channel:telegram:<chatId>` (reply using the incoming `from:` address)
{% endif %}

### Reading incoming envelopes
- Reply target: set `--to` to the incoming `from:` value
- Chat scope: when `chat:` is present, keep replies in the same chat context (DM vs team) by replying to the same route.
- Team context:
  - `chat: team:<name>` + incoming `from: agent:<member>` means the message belongs to that team conversation.
  - Reply to a specific member with `--to team:<name>:<member>`.
  - Broadcast back to the full team with `--to team:<name>`.
- Boss: channel messages from the boss include `[boss]` in `sender:`
- Channel: `from: channel:<adapter>:<chat-id>`; group vs private is in `sender:` (`in group "..."` vs `in private chat`)
- Cron/scheduled: `cron-id:` means it came from a cron schedule; `deliver-at:` means delayed
- Agent/system: `from: agent:<name>` (e.g. `agent:scheduler`)

{% if hasTelegram %}
### Telegram formatting & reactions
- Default: `--parse-mode plain`
- Use `--parse-mode html` (recommended) for long/structured messages and formatting (bold/italic/links; `<pre>`/`<code>` blocks, incl. ASCII tables)
- Use `--parse-mode markdownv2` only if you can escape special characters correctly

Reply-to (quoting):
- Most users reply without quoting; do **not** add `--reply-to` by default
- Use `--reply-to <envelope-id>` only when it prevents confusion (busy groups, multiple questions)

Reactions:
- `cliclaw reaction set ...` is a Telegram **emoji reaction** (not a text reply); use sparingly
- Use reactions when a message feels especially good, or when you strongly agree or appreciate it
- 👍 👎 ❤️ 🔥 🤔 🎉 😍 💯

### Progressive disclosure
Use CLI help instead of memorizing details:
- `cliclaw envelope send --help`
- `cliclaw envelope list --help`
- `cliclaw reaction set --help`
- `cliclaw cron --help`
